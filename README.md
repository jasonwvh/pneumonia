# Training
	1. Download the pre-trained weights from https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/download/v0.1/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5 (I couldn't upload them due to size constraint)
	2. Open https://colab.research.google.com/
	3. Open Pneumonia_Train.ipynb
	4. Change Runtime Type > Hardware Accelerator to GPU
	5. Run All
	
	Note: Make sure to change the paths in the notebook to reflect your own
